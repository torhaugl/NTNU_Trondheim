Forslag til modellering

Predict concenctration at times
When do concentration 'spike'
When should we start to measure biofilm, how often (often during spike)
How growth medium changes biofilm

With bacteriophage
	How much is implemented
	How much is transferred to next generation
	Survival of bacteriophages?

M13 decreases cell growth

TODO Myself
	Output to .csv for easy use in other programs
	All output in 1 file?
	Implement better timestep / more substeps (5 sec dt).
	Loading bar
	Clean code
	Documentation!



Collaboration:
Input file
	Automatically create many input modules, followed by compiling and executing the code. Should output to different folders as well.

Ouptput file
	Plot data?
	From standard output to reasonable plot?
